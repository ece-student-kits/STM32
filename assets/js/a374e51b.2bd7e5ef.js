I\'ve served as a coordinator and volunteer in various workshops conducted in the college and have hands-on experience with platforms like Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, 8051, and LoRaWAN. I enjoy exploring new domains and technologies, and I thrive on interacting with people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Initiative\\r\\nMy inspiration to create this documentation website came from a site built by friends for a Gen AI Bootcamp using Docusaurus.
